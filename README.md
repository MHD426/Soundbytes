# Soundbytes
Project made for an HCI class testing pitch accuracy through microphone that aspires to be an ear ear trainer.

# Launching
To launch the program, use the Sounbytes(Prototype) executable (.exe file). Make sure you have a microphone enabled as the program uses
the default or currently selected input device at launch.

# Pitch Accuracy
Soundbytes currently using a pitch estimator based from Thomas Drugman and Abeer Alwan's 'Joint Robust Voicing Detection and Pitch 
Estimation Based on Residual Harmonics'.  https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2001.00459
The program records input from the microphone and estimates the fundamental frequency using the sum of residual harmonics.
